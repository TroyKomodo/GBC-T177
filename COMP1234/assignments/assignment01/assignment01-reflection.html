    <h1>Assignment 01 Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        While completing assignment 01, I learnt how to create folders using bash syntax.<br>
        Since I use linux for devlopment I was able to mount the FTP server as a local drive, and then I can use terminal commands to create files. <br>
        For example: <br>
        <pre><code>
            mkdir -p assignments/assignment0{1..3}/assets/{img,css}
            mkdir -p lab/excercise/wk{01..15}
        </code></pre>

        This saved me a lot of time and effort in creating the folders and subfolders for the assignment.<br>

        Going through my links I found that one or 2 of them were broken, so I had to go back and fix them,<br>
        To do that I went to where the link was supposed to go to and copied the path and then pasted it into the href attribute.<br>
        <br>

        I learnt that HTML is related to the directory structure of the web server, so if you want to link to a file you have to use the path to that file.<br>
        For example: <br>
        <pre><code>
            &lt;a href=&quot;./assets/css&quot;&gt;Assignment01 CSS - (R) ./assets/css&lt;/a&gt;
        </code></pre>
            
        The above link will take you to the css folder in the assets folder in the assignment01 folder.<br>
        The path is relative to the current page, so if you are in the assignment01 folder, you can use the above link to go to the css folder.<br>
        <br>

        The most difficult part of the assignment was trying to figure out what the actual assignment was.<br>
        I had to go back and read the assignment instructions a few times to figure out what I was supposed to do.<br>
        <br>
