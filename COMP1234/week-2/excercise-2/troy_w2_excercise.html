    <h3>My favorite sport is hockey</h3>
    <p>
      I like hockey because it is fast paced and exciting. I also like hockey
      because it is a team sport and I like to work with others. Hockey is
      really fun and easy to get into. I have been playing hockey since I was 5
      years old and I have loved it ever since.
